## Overview

BATI is a Unified Chain-of-Thought (UniCoT) reasoning framework designed to empower Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform complex reasoning across both text and vision modalities.        
By decomposing a given task into simple, modular steps and executing them sequentially or in parallel, BATI aims to enable unified large models to tackle a broad range of multimodal applications, including:

* Visual planning
* Geometric and physical reasoning
* Highly reliable image generation/editing

The BATI reasoning pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Planning**: Decompose the complex task into a sequence of simpler, manageable subtasks.
2. **Subtask Execution**: Execute each subtask using the unified model with step-by-step reasoning.
3. **Self-Check**: After completing each subtask, perform a validation check to ensure the intermediate result aligns with the intended goal.
4. **Final Result**: Aggregate the validated subtask results to generate the final output.
