## Overview
While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been proven effective for complex text-based tasks, extending it to multimodal scenarios introduces new challenges. In visual contexts, human reasoning often relies on understanding how visual states evolve over time, such as tracking object movements and spatial interactions. This demands that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) reason not only at the textual level but also effectively incorporate and interpret visual cues.

To tackle this, we introduce **Uni-CoT**, a unified reasoning framework that extends CoT principles to the **multimodal domain**, empowering Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform **interpretable**, **step-by-step reasoning** across both **text and vision**. The core idea is to decompose complex multimodal tasks into structured, manageable steps that can be executed **sequentially or in parallel**, enabling more scalable and systematic reasoning as shown below. More details refer to [Technical report](./docs/technical_report.md).

*Note: We would like to thank the [Bagel team](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Bagel) for integrating strong text and image generation capabilities into a single model, which enables Uni-CoT to be implemented elegantly at current time.*

### üß† Reasoning Pipeline

The Uni-CoT framework adopts a four-stage modular reasoning process:

1. **Planning**: Decompose the overall task into a sequence of subtasks.
2. **Subtask Execution**: Solve each subtask with step-by-step multimodal reasoning.
3. **Self-Check**: Validate intermediate outputs before proceeding.
4. **Final Aggregation**: Integrate validated results into the final output.

### üöÄ Applications
The Uni-CoT framework aims to solve complex multimodal tasks, including:
* üîç Visual and physical reasoning
* üß© Visual planning
* üé® Reliable image generation and editing
* üìñ Multimodal story understanding

### Quantitative Results on WISE  
We first conduct experiments on the [WISE](https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/WISE) dataset to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of our method.
As shown in the table below, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among existing open-source unified models.

Furthermore, we apply our self-check mechanism to the images generated by the original Bagel model with think mode, aiming to evaluate our method‚Äôs ability to calibrate erroneous outputs.
The results in the table below demonstrate that our model effectively refines the imperfect outputs generated by Bagel.

## Quickstart

### Installation

The environment setup of Uni-CoT is consistent with its base model, [Bagel](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Bagel).

```
git clone https://github.com/Fr0zenCrane/UniCoT.git
cd UniCoT
conda create -n unicot python=3.10 -y
conda activate unicot
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flash_attn==2.5.8 --no-build-isolation
```

### Model Download

You may directly download the huggingface [checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/Fr0zencr4nE/UniCoT-7B-MoT) or use the following script:

*Note: Due to our internet speed limitation, the checkpoint of UniCoT-7B-MoT is still uploadding. This should be finished in a day.*

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download

save_dir = "models/UniCoT-7B-MoT"
repo_id = "Fr0zencr4nE/UniCoT-7B-MoT"
cache_dir = save_dir + "/cache"

snapshot_download(cache_dir=cache_dir,
  local_dir=save_dir,
  repo_id=repo_id,
  local_dir_use_symlinks=False,
  resume_download=True,
  allow_patterns=["*.json", "*.safetensors", "*.bin", "*.py", "*.md", "*.txt"],
)
```


### Self-check Reasoning

To perform evaluation using UniCoT-7B-MoT, you need at least one GPU with 80GB or more VRAM. While lower GPU configurations are acceptable, they are not recommended due to potential performance limitations.

#### Evaluation
To reproduce our results on WISE benchmark, you can use script `./scripts/run_wise_self_reflection.sh`, you may specify your local checkpoint of UniCoT-7B-MoT and output dir using `--model_path` and `outdir`.

```python
gpu_num=8

for i in $(seq 0 $((gpu_num-1)));
do
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$i python inference_mdp_self_reflection_wise.py \
        --group_id $i \
        --group_num $gpu_num \
        --model_path "Fr0zencr4nE/UniCoT-7B-MoT" \
        --data_path "./eval/gen/wise/final_data.json" \
        --outdir "./results" \
        --cfg_text_scale 4 > process_log_$i.log 2>&1 &
done

wait
echo "All background processes finished."
```

#### Inference
For general inference, prepare your prompts by formatting them into a `.txt` file, with one prompt per line, with one prompt per line, you can find a demonstration of this in the repository as `test_prompts.txt`. Once your prompts are ready, use the script `./scripts/run_user_self_reflection.sh` to generate images from your prompts with the added benefit of the self-reflection mechanism.

```python
gpu_num=8

for i in $(seq 0 $((gpu_num-1)));
do
    CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=$i python inference_mdp_self_reflection.py \
        --group_id $i \
        --group_num $gpu_num \
        --model_path "Fr0zencr4nE/UniCoT-7B-MoT" \
        --data_path "./test_prompts.txt" \
        --outdir "./results" \
        --cfg_text_scale 4 > process_log_$i.log 2>&1 &
done

wait
echo "All background processes finished."
```
