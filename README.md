# **BATI**: **BA**gel-based Unified Chain of Thought Across **T**ext and **Image** 

[[Project]](https://github.com/SAIS-FUXI/projects) / [[Report]](technical_report.md) / [[Model]](https://huggingface.co)

## Overview

BATI is a Unified Chain-of-Thought (UniCoT) reasoning framework designed to empower Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform complex reasoning across both text and vision modalities.
By decomposing a given task into simple, modular steps and executing them sequentially or in parallel, BATI aims to enable unified large models to tackle a broad range of multimodal applications, including:

* Visual planning
* Geometric and physical reasoning
* Highly reliable image and video generation/editing

The BATI reasoning pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Planning**: Decompose the complex task into a sequence of simpler, manageable subtasks.
2. **Subtask Execution**: Execute each subtask using the unified model with step-by-step reasoning.
3. **Self-Check**: After completing each subtask, perform a validation check to ensure the intermediate result aligns with the intended goal.
4. **Final Result**: Aggregate the validated subtask results to generate the final output.

## Acknowledgement

- This project is based on [Bagel](https://github.com/ByteDance-Seed/Bagel) proposed by ByteDance-Seed team. Bagel is a powerful and popular unified model for multimodal understanding and generation, making it an ideal foundation and startup for this project. We thank the ByteDance-Seed team for their outstanding work, which has made BATI possible.
